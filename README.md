# OpenCV Face Recognition

This repositiry is a modified copy of the code that can be found at: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/24/opencv-face-recognition/

It uses OpenCV (plus a few other libraries) to build a solution that uses images to do face recognition for both still frame and video.
It does this without using dlib.

Lots of details about how it works can be found at that site.
