# OpenCV Face Recognition

This repositiry is a modified copy of the code that can be found at: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/24/opencv-face-recognition/

It uses OpenCV (plus a few other libraries) to build a solution that uses images to do face recognition for both still frame and video.
It does this without using dlib.

Lots of details about how it works can be found at that site.

There is a large (30MB) file that you need for the extract/embedding/train sequence (but not the recognise, I think) which is too big to upload here. You will need to get it from a source code option from the above site, or from somewhere else.
The file is called: openface_nn4.small2.v1.t7 and should be placed in the same (parent) folder as the python files.

Note that all my libraries were installed using PIP3 and I ran all my code as Python3.
If you wish to do this then when the web site gives instructions to run Python from the command line either add the digit 3 to the Python, or run it from a Python3 IDE like Thonny and include your run time arguments to match what is supplied on the web site.
